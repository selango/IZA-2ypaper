macro:->Another
common
benefit
that
formal
workers
have,
although
the
law
does
not
enforce
it,
is
access
to
a
savings
fund
which
works
as
follows.
The
firm
discounts
certain
amount
from
the
worker's
labor
income
and
invests
it
in
a
worker
savings
fund.
For
each
worker,
the
firm
invests
a
similar
amount
from
that
discounted
from
the
worker's
labor
income.
This
amount
is
called
firm's
contribution.
At
the
end
of
the
year,
the
worker
receives
the
total
amount
discounted
over
the
year
together
with
the
firm's
contribution
and
interest
payments.
